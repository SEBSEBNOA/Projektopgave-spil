Both sides battle it out to control territories on a large scale battle map, voting on which territories to attack, whether to attempt to take more territory, or to defend and try to grind down the enemy's resources. We like to say it is like a \u201cmeta-game&quot; of Risk. This features both Stalingrad and Pacific Theater campaigns. <br><\/li><li>All new level: Betio. The tiny island of Betio was the scene of the heaviest fighting during the Battle of Tarawa in November 1943, the first major US amphibious offensive of the Pacific Theater. The map here recreates the push of the US 2nd Marine Division across the devastated island against their counterparts in the 6th Special Naval Landing Force (the Japanese 'Marines') as the US forces attempt to disable key tactical objectives such as naval guns and transmitter stations. The map favors desperate pitched defenses and assaults at all costs. <br><\/li><li>Two new weapons, one for Rising Storm and one for Red Orchestra 2. Red Orchestra 2 gets the PPS-42 submachine gun. Born out of desperation during the siege of Leningrad, the PPS-42 provides the Russians with a powerful, lightweight SMG option. For Rising Storm, the Japanese get the Type 97 sniper rifle. More accurate than the existing Type 99 sniper rifle, this weapon gives the Japanese another way to reach out and touch their enemies. <br><\/li><li>Classic Mode Refinements. While Rising Storm and Red Orchestra 2 are considered by many to be one of the most hardcore shooters out there, the hardcore among the fan base have been clamoring for something even more extreme and authentic. The fans have asked and we've answered with further refinements to Classic Mode (the most hardcore gameplay mode in RS/RO2). We've made player movement changes, as well as aiming and recoil changes to make it more difficult to keep your aim on enemies resulting in longer and more intense firefights. <\/li><\/ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Previous Updates:<\/h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Counterattack Map Contest Pack 1: 4 new maps!<br><\/li><li>Counterattack Map Contest Pack 2: 3 new maps!<\/li><\/ul><\/p><br><h1>Digital Deluxe Edition<\/h1><p><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/234510/extras/game_page_banner_tweaked.jpg\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Day 1 Unlock of: the US M12 Trench shotgun, the Japanese Type 99 Machine Gun, the Japanese Type 99 Sniper Rifle with 4X scope (level 2), and the US M1 Garand with bayonet (Level 2).<br><\/li><li>2 Rising Storm soldier playable characters for Killing Floor. <br><\/li><li>Rising Storm and Red Orchestra 2 soundtracks.<br><\/li><li>Will include the Red Orchestra 2 Steam Digital Deluxe Edition Upgrade (4 day 1 unlock weapons, 2 playable RO2 KF characters, and 2 RO2 hats in TF2).<\/li><\/ul><\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>INCLUDES ALL RED ORCHESTRA 2 MULTIPLAYER CONTENT!<\/strong><\/h2><br>Rising Storm is the next game in the award-winning Red Orchestra franchise. You know the great gameplay, innovative features and realistic audio and graphics of RO2 - Rising Storm will take this to the Pacific Theater, adding even more features, new levels, new weapons and new factions. The game will allow the player to fight across iconic locations from the famous island-hopping campaigns in the Pacific from 1942 to 1945, as the US Army and Marine Corps fight it out with the Imperial Japanese army and Special Naval Landing Forces. Players will experience beach assaults, jungle fighting, close quarters night fighting and more across Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima and Saipan, among other iconic battles. The player is able to take the part of either side \u2013 American or Japanese \u2013 battling it out online in multiplayer on up to 64-player servers.<br><br>Rising Storm also introduces an entirely new type of gameplay to the franchise - asymmetrical warfare. The American\u2019s have the apparent advantage in firepower with their fast firing semi-automatic rifles, fully automatic weapons, and devastating flamethrower. The Japanese balance this out with gameplay elements that model their raw courage, ferocity, and cunning use of equipment. Their knee mortars allow them to rain indirect fire down on their enemies from anywhere in the map. Grenades can be planted and turned into booby-traps for unwary GIs. The Japanese put very high store on close-quarter combat, with a bayonet on almost every weapon \u2013 even machine guns and SMGs. Their banzai charge suppresses the enemy making it difficult for them to return fire and gives them an opportunity to close in to use bayonets and katanas on their opponents.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features<\/h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tLarge Scale Multiplayer Combat in The Pacific: Take part in the brutal fighting in the Pacific online with up to 64 players at a time.<br><\/li><li>\tIconic Battles:  Experience iconic battles such as Iwo Jima, Saipan, and Guadalcanal as the US military struggles to clear the Japanese from the islands in the Pacific.<br><\/li><li>\tAsymmetrical Gameplay: Far from the mirrored gameplay seen in other shooters, both sides utilize historical weapon sets and each have unique gameplay capabilities. American firepower is matched by Japanese ferocity and guile with such features as banzai charges, booby-traps, the infamous \u201cknee mortar\u201d and more. This creates a unique gameplay experience that can\u2019t be found anywhere else. <br><\/li><li>\tWWII weaponry redefined \u2013 again: all of the weapon functionality you expect from the franchise returns - true to life ballistics, bullet penetration, breathing, adjustable sights, free aim, weapon bracing, and more, create WWII weaponry that has no equal. To that add over 20 new weapons including the devastating flamethrower and the portable \u201cknee mortar\u201d.<br><\/li><li>\tMorale: Your soldier\u2019s state of mind plays a bigger role than ever. Banzai charging Japanese soldiers can heavily suppress the Americans making it difficult to return fire and allowing the Japanese to close the distance.  The Americans can use their firepower advantage to suppress their enemies and gain the advantage!<br><\/li><li>\tBonus Content: All Red Orchestra 2 multiplayer content is included with Rising Storm as a free bonus. Fight in the Pacific, then fight on the Eastern Front at any time, all in the same game and same server browser.

Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Story<\/h2>The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike.<br><br><br>Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well.<br><br>But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed.

Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the Rings and Spinal Tap, it\u2019s a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which in this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving humanity and Heavy metal tunes. Featuring the talents of comedian, actor and musician, Jack Black as super roadie Eddie Riggs, as well as cameos by some of the biggest names in metal music it's a wild ride in the belly of the beast that is not to be missed by gamers and Metalheads alike.<br> <br><br>Included as a free bonus in the PC version of Brütal Legend are both the Hammer of Infinite Fate and Tears of the Hextadon multiplayer map packs.<br><br><br><strong>Story<\/strong><br>The vivid and wildly creative world of Brütal Legend is brought to life through a spate of chrome, leather, rocker babes, epic music, fire-breathing/stud-wearing beasts, mountains made of guitar amps, and more. Follow Eddie as he embarks on a tour of epic destruction with an axe, a guitar, and his minions as he commands the power of rock in epic band battles. It\u2019s lighter-flicking awesomeness that will melt your face clean off.<br><br><br><strong>Combat<\/strong><br>Brütal Legend\u2019s combat is a combination of classic action slasher and real time strategy mechanics.  Melee and ranged combat come from your double-sided broadaxe and demon-slaying, pyrotechnic-creating guitar.  Add that 1-2 punch to a guitar solo mechanic that can summon objects, buff your teammates, or cripple your opponents, and you have a deep, gratifying core gameplay combat loop that is fun for the hardcore and accessible for the casual.  On top of that, players will journey from Roadie to Rock God by commanding legions of metalheads into Brütal Victory and sending troops charging into battle.<br><br><br><strong>A Streaming Open World<\/strong><br>Brütal Legend gives you the freedom to walk, drive, or fly anywhere in a fully streaming open world whose art style is inspired by some of the most iconic and hilariously rad metal album covers ever created. Every vista in the beautiful universe of Brütal Legend looks like it was pulled from a Frank Frazetta painting.<br><br><br><strong>Packed With Cameos and Voice Talent<\/strong><br>Brütal Legend is full of cameos from gods of metal like Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Lita Ford, and many, many others. It has a MASSIVE metal soundtrack from every era of metal music: 1970\u2019s classic metal to 1980\u2019s hair metal to the scarier cousins of 1990\u2019s metal. And of course, Jack Black pays the ultimate homage to metal as Eddie the Roadie, continuing the theme from the work of his band, Tenacious D and his previous films like School of Rock and High Fidelity.<br><br><br><strong>Multiplayer Mayhem<\/strong><br>4v4 &quot;skirmish&quot; multiplayer marries action combat with a strategic unit-control mechanic. As the leader of one of the factions in the game, the player will direct his armies in a Battle of the Bands where the trophy is survival. Brütal Legend\u2019s multiplayer is online-enabled, so you can conquer your friends online (broadband connection required for online play).<br><br><br><strong>Music<\/strong><br>The music in Brütal Legend is truly massive. Made up of 108 of the most rocking tracks from 75 different bands representing every sub-genre of metal, it is something to experience in and of itself.",

A detailed strategic layer allows you to co-ordinate the defence of the planet, using your interceptors to shoot down UFOs and researching captured artefacts to learn about your foes and unlock new combat equipment to use on your missions.<br><br>Xenonauts is a spiritual successor to the classic X-Com strategy games from the 1990s. We aim to improve the graphics, add new content and streamline the interface whilst still retaining all of the key mechanics of the original games. Devoted fans should love this game, but we're also keen to introduce the joys of old-school grand strategy to a whole new generation of players who might not otherwise experience it!<br><br>Please note that the native Mac / Linux versions of the game are still in beta, however older WINE-wrapped &quot;ports&quot; are available and known to be stable whilst development of the native ports is still ongoing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features<\/h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Ground Combat: Xenonauts delivers tense turn-based combat across realistic, varied and fully-destructible battlefields, against almost fifty different variants of enemy. Missions range from capturing crashed UFOs or alien bases to defending cities (or even Xenonaut facilities) against alien attack. You'll experience the chill of encountering a new alien for the first time and the joys of test-firing a new weapon for the first time. Deeply asymmetric combat keeps the battles interesting - after all, you're fighting intergalactic invaders with 1970's ballistic technology!<\/li><\/ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Strategic Management: You will also be managing the defence of the planet, dealing with the invading alien UFOs with your customisable interceptors. You need to balance the needs of your funding nations with your own. Your funds are limited - are you going to spend them on battlefield equipment, more scientists, or expanding your coverage of the planet? Your priorities must be balanced carefully if you are to win the war.<\/li><\/ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Research Tree: Xenonauts has an extensive research tree with almost a hundred projects to unlock, each with its own unique description and painted artwork. It slowly reveals the intentions and origins of the invaders, while also unlocking new battlefield equipment, aircraft and vehicles for you to use as you harness alien technology and turn it against them. <\/li><\/ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Persistent Soldiers: Soldiers in Xenonauts are persistent from mission to mission, improving their stats and gaining ranks with combat experience - but their deaths are always only a single bad move away. You will grow to care about the brave men and women under your command as they slowly grow from green rookies into hardened veterans, but that only makes it more painful when their heroic tale is cruelly cut short by a burst of plasma fire...<\/li><\/ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Detailed, Emergent Simulation: Xenonauts contains no scripted missions, just broad rules setting the pace of the invasion. As such, no game plays out the same twice. If you shoot a Scout UFO down over a polar area, you get a Crash Site mission where you can capture a crashed Scout UFO in an Arctic tileset. Commence a battle at night and you'll be fighting the mission in the darkness with reduced sight range. If your base is attacked, you fight the defence in a perfect replica of your base. A lot of time has gone into weaving the two very different halves of the game together into something that feels both natural and enjoyable.<\/li><\/ul>",

For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand.<br><br><i>Firefight<\/i> --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork.<br><br><i>Skirmish<\/i> --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match.<br><br><i>Occupy<\/i> --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or &quot;tug of war&quot;.<br><br><i>Ambush<\/i> --- A high value target (&quot;HVT&quot;) must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate.<br><br><i>Strike<\/i> --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry.<br><br><i>Infiltrate<\/i> --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy.<br><br><i>Flashpoint<\/i> --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective.<br><br><i>Elimination<\/i> --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cooperative Game Modes<\/h2><br><i>Checkpoint<\/i> --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way.<br><br><i>Hunt<\/i> --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life.<br><br><i>Survival<\/i> --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates.<br><br><i>Outpost<\/i> --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates.<br><br><i>Conquer<\/i> --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them.

    "detailedDescription": "In this retelling of Dante's origin story which is set against a contemporary backdrop, DmC Devil May Cry™ retains the stylish action, fluid combat and self-assured protagonist that have defined the iconic series but inject a more brutal and visceral edge. <br><br>The Dante of DmC is a young man who has no respect for authority or indeed society in general. Dante knows that he is not human, but also that he is not like the demons that have tormented him throughout his life. Caught between worlds, he feels like an outcast. <br>Thanks to his twin brother Vergil, leader of the anti-establishment group called \u201cThe Order\u201d, Dante is now discovering and coming to terms with what it means to be the child of a demon and an angel. This split personality has a real impact on gameplay with Dante being able to call upon angel and demon abilities at will, transforming his Rebellion sword on the fly to dramatically affect both combat and movement. <br><br>For DmC Capcom has teamed up with UK development studio, Ninja Theory, renown for delivering action titles with compelling characters and narrative coupled with high production values. The combination of Ninja Theory\u2019s expertise and Capcom\u2019s unrivalled heritage in producing combat focused action titles will ensure that this latest addition to the over 11-million selling series will remain true to the Devil May Cry DNA so cherished by the fans, while bringing a new level of cinematic quality to the title.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features<\/h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Survive Limbo<\/strong> - The world of Limbo is a living and breathing entity, out to kill Dante.

PlanetSide 2 battles persist and the war never ends, offering constant challenges of individual skill, team grit, and empire-wide coordination. Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat. <br><br>Players come together in enormous battles across four massive continents to win control of critical territories, gaining key resources for their empire. With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THREE WARRING EMPIRES<\/strong> <\/h2>Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218230/extras/PS2_3_Empires.jpg?t=1668718915\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MASSIVE WARFARE<\/strong> <\/h2>Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>ENORMOUS MAPS<\/strong> <\/h2>PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings. <br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218230/extras/PS2_4_massive_continents.jpg?t=1668718915\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS<\/strong> <\/h2>In PlanetSide 2 the war isn\u2019t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CLASS-BASED COMBAT<\/strong><\/h2>Players can build their soldier to match wants and their allies' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics. Grow your soldier over time as you master each combat role, weapon, and vehicle, laterally unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, gear, skills, vehicles, and more.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218230/extras/PS2_6_Classes.jpg?t=1668718915\" /><br><br><strong>Heavy Assault:<\/strong> Rush into the battle guns blazing.

You are the beating heart of any squad. <br><br><strong>Infiltrator:<\/strong> Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper's nest. You are the enemy's constant fear. <br><br><strong>Engineer: <\/strong> Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. <br><br><strong>MAX:<\/strong> Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX).

    "detailedDescription": "A project over eleven years in the making, Cortex Command has rich 2D pixel graphics coupled with an extremely detailed physics engine, which allows for highly replayable and emergent real-time action. There is also a turn-based strategic campaign mode which ties the tactical fights together, featuring persistent terrains that will accumulate the battle scars, debris, and bunker ruins through your entire campaign. <br><br>Choose from several unique technology factions, each featuring their own sets of expendable soldier bodies, mechas, weapons, tools, and landing craft. Protect your brain, mine the gold, and destroy the enemy cortex in his bunker complex!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:<\/h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Fully destructible environments<\/strong> - The gold you need to excavate is sprinkled throughout the terrain of each scene. Use special digging tools to blast your way into the dirt and debris. All the pieces of bodies and ships from your struggles will fall to the ground and permanently add to the battlefield. Get more powerful (and expensive) diggers and you can even tunnel into your enemies' bunkers from below!<br><br><\/li><li><strong>Strategic metagame campaign<\/strong> \u2013 The intense, real-time tactical battles are put in a greater strategic context in the Campaign mode, thus giving each battle meaning and consequence. The gold-rich terrains on the planet and the defensive bunkers you build to defend them are persistent from fight to fight. This means there will be layers of debris, bunker ruins, tunnels, and corpses piled up in layers, telling the history of each place throughout each campaign played.<br><br><\/li><li><strong>In-game buying menu<\/strong> - At any time and place during the game, bring up a powerful menu to order new bodies and equipment, all delivered at the location and by the transport ship of your choosing. Rockets are cheaper but unreliable and harder to land. Drop ships are far more expensive but can quickly deploy entire groups of puppets onto difficult terrain. Ships and equipment returned to the TradeStar are refunded to your account.<br><br><\/li><li><strong>Build your own bunker<\/strong> - At the start of most missions, you are able to take your time and build your own command bunker from scratch. Easily design twisting tunnels and place doors, traps, and turrets to thwart your enemies' intrusions! Pre-deploy and equip bodies in and around your installation to prepare yourself for your objectives. Don't spend too much though, or you won't have enough funds left when the mission starts!<br><br><\/li><li><strong>Four-player cooperative and/or versus multiplayer<\/strong> - Gather your friends and plug in those game controllers! Play skirmish or campaign missions with or against up to three of your buddies. 2 vs 2, 1 vs. 3, 4 vs. the CPU - it's up to you! (rhyme intended). Flexible control settings allow you to use the keyboard, keyboard + mouse, or any generic game controller you can find and plug in.<br><br><\/li><li><strong>Built-in editors and modding<\/strong> - Several in-game editors allow you to easily create your own stuff. The game's engine is built to make it very simple to modify and add your own content. Design your own missions, guys, ships, weapons, tools, bombs, and shields - and easily share them with your friends.

An adventure game that lets you free-roam a vast, procedurally-generated world. A Valley Without Wind defies genre stereotypes. Unlike other procedurally-generated games, you also get a logical progression in difficulty, plus helpful tips and checklists to guide your travels (should you need them).<br>Choose for yourself how to prepare to face the vastly stronger Overlord. Complete a variety of missions to earn new spells, and/or roam the wilds to uncover secret missions and stashes of magical crafting loot. Customize your characters with unique combinations of enchants and spells that change how you move, jump, and fight. Or rescue people and bring them back to your settlement so that they can then be sent on dispatch missions; you don't have to carry the burden of your fledgling civilization alone! <br>You choose how to play, and the world adapts around you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:<\/h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Travel alone or with friends across an ever-expanding world of dangerous creatures, powerful magic, high technology, and mysteries. <br><\/li><li>You have choice. The world of Environ is a procedurally generated sandbox, and lets you go anywhere you see -- including right into the overlord's keep at any time. (Good luck with that.) <br><\/li><li>Environ is endless. When you save one continent from an overlord, a larger and more complex continent appears. <br><\/li><li>The game adapts to how you play: as you demonstrate your proficiency, monsters and missions upgrade accordingly. Killed 100 bats? Okay, time for... bats on fire! <br><\/li><li>Crazy amounts of character customization. Combine a multitude of spells, enchants, and equipment to create specialized character builds. <br><\/li><li>Play as a long line of brave adventurers. It's not a question of IF your character is going to die, but WHEN. Any character that dies is permanently lost, but you keep all your inventory, enchants, and general progress in the game. <br><\/li><li>Become a community leader. Rescue NPCs for your settlement, construct buildings for them, and improve their skill and mood -- then send them on dispatch missions to help you in return! <br><\/li><li>Be a clever problem-solver. Challenges have more than one solution, each with its own pros and cons. You get to figure things out rather than just jumping through a set of hoops. <br><\/li><li>Difficulty levels give exactly the challenge you want, from casual to hardcore on platforming, combat, and citybuilding independently. <br><\/li><li>All owners of Valley 1 also get the much-improved sequel absolutely free!  Valley 2 is out now, and features a different style of more-focused, non-sandbox play.

For centuries the kingdom has been at odds with neighboring Nostria, but now first steps are being undertaken toward a lasting peace.

Moreover, there are those among the citizens of Andergast who swear that the crows are bringing them dark nightmares. As the belligerent creatures infiltrate even the castle itself, the king seeks a skilled bird catcher - an opportunity for young Geron to prove that the reputation for ill luck that has followed him since childhood is undeserved.

As Japan begins to modernise and industrialise, the inevitable social and economic changes lead to increasingly militant nationalism and antipathy towards the Shogunate.<br><br>Play as a clan supporting the Imperial throne (Choshu, Satsuma, Tosa), or the last Shogunate (Aizu, Nagaoka, Jozai) in a sandbox campaign map reflecting the time period of 19th century Japan.<br><br>The American, British and French nations play an important part in the story of the Boshin war, and your relations with these foreign powers will be integral to unit recruitment and to advancing your technology trees.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/201271/extras/FallOfTheSamurai_GIF2.gif?t=1624275412\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>About the Saga Faction Pack<\/strong><\/h2><br><br><strong>The Modernisers<\/strong><br><br>Centuries of trade with outsiders has given the people of Saga an understanding of foreign and modern ways, allowing them to adopt new military technology quickly.<br><br>The Saga domain is ruled by Nabeshima Mochizuru, the latest in a line of daimyo who were given this territory after the Tokugawa won the vicious civil war of the Sengoku Jidai. The Saga did well by being sensible enough to join the Tokugawa cause while there was still some doubt over the result. They did not wait until the Battle of Sekigahara to decide where their true loyalties lay.<br><br>The domain includes the port of Nagasaki, a valuable resource for any daimyo. It is here that Japan has its only official trade with the West, and it is here that interesting ideas arrive in the country. Perhaps this knowledge of the harshness of the outside world is what has convinced the Saga to throw their weight behind the Imperial Court rather than the Shogun.<br><br>The Saga clan can rely on a few advantages in the coming struggle: they have Western connections and trade that is far ahead of any other domain. In turn, this learning allows them to be artillery experts, and have good shipbuilding and industrial facilities. The modern world has much to offer to those who would embrace it. Interestingly, the historical Nabeshima Mochizuru eventually resigned his position and left Japan to study in England.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>About the Obama Faction Pack<\/strong><\/h2><br><br><strong>The Overseers<\/strong><br><br>With long experience of government and administration, the authoritarian people of Obama are unsurpassed in controlling people and trade.<br><br>The Sakai clan, the rulers of Obama, are firm supporters of the Shogunate. The original Sakai lord of the domain, Sakai Tadakatsu, was one of the roju, or elders, under Tokugawa Ieyasu, the first Shogun. This was a hugely important post in the affairs of Japan, and Tadakatsu was correspondingly powerful within the Shogunate's administration. The Sakai clan could also claim to be related to the Minamoto clan, and to be cousins of both the Tokugawa and the Matsudaira clans. They are, then, very well connected. Their domain is worthy of them. The town of Obama had been a prosperous trading port, but its importance declined as Japan closed itself off from the outside world. It remained an important link to Ezo, modern Hokkaido.<br><br>Because of their long experience of government and administration, they are experts at managing the population of their lands. They receive a taxation bonus and are highly efficient at repression. They also spend money wisely, and they pay less upkeep for land units. All their garrison troops are also of high quality.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>About the Tsu Faction Pack<\/strong><\/h2><br><br><strong>The Betrayers<\/strong><br><br>Rising from humble roots, the people of Tsu are wise, artful and astute strategists. Their use of Ninja is unsurpassed on the battlefield and in covert operations.<br><br>The Todo clan, rulers of the Tsu domain, cannot claim a proud samurai lineage like many of the other great clans of Japan. Their beginnings are actually rather humble: Todo Takatora was an ashigaru, a peasant footsoldier, during the great wars of the Sengoku Jidai. So what? So too was the mighty general Toyotomi Hideyoshi, revered as one of the three great unifiers of Japan! Todo Takatora was wise enough to side with the Tokugawa clan at Sekigahara, and he was rewarded with the fief of Tsu, comprising a good part of the provinces of Iga and Ise.<br><br>Historically, the Tsu chose to play a &quot;long game&quot;, apparently supporting the Shogunate until the very last moment. At the Battle of Toba-Fushimi they sided with the Choshu and Satsuma domains, and therefore with the Imperial forces. They then provided the Imperialists with a strategic position to continue the drive towards Kyoto. Their central position on the mainland, in what is now Mie Prefecture, lay between Edo and Kyoto, and this allowed them enviable flexibility and options in their loyalties. Such flexibility goes some way to explain why they have such excellent shinobi at their command.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>About the Sendai Faction Pack<\/strong><\/h2><br><br><strong>The Negotiators<\/strong><br><br>Fiercely loyal to the incumbent Tokugawa Shogunate, the noble people of Sendai endured the ages of turmoil to emerge as respected tacticians and sublime diplomats.<br><br>Date Yoshikuni, the lord of Sendai, is loyal to the Shogunate. His family have been loyal to the Tokugawa clan since the end of the wars of the Sengoku Jidai. Then, Date Masamune had proven himself worthy, and established the domain with the blessing of the first Shogun. Even before then, the Sendai had been a noble and notable family of samurai, beginning as the Isa clan under the Minamoto. Given control of the Date province, and taking the name as their own, they survived centuries of turmoil. They have done this by political guile, implacable enemies, and fierce warriors. Now, as lords of Sendai, they are still all of those, even after centuries of relative peace. In battle, Sendai armies have longer when attacking, and need to defend for less time, making victory less of a race to achieve. The Sendai also have a bonus to all diplomatic efforts and are tolerant towards people with different allegiance.",

    "detailedDescription": "The Infinity is the largest spaceship ever built by man-kind; flung into the void of space to secure humanity a new home amongst the stars. However, instead of discovering paradise, the inhabitants of The Infinity unlocked the door to a long forgotten nightmare. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDeep inside this leviathan something terrible hunts, out of myth and legend the last werewolf stalks the ship. Infinity Runner centres on a prisoner desperately trying to escape the decaying ship and the clutches of the terror within. It\u2019s a sci-fi action running game for PC, Mac, and Linux that features 14 action packed levels, Oculus Rift DK1 &amp; DK2 (Runtime 4.4) support and online multi-player.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Infinity Runner, the player controls the protagonist, the prisoner, from a first-person perspective as he is challenged to escape from the gargantuan spaceship. This is accomplished by use of techniques and movements inspired by the disciplines of parkour and mixed martial arts, the game-play conveys the players strain and physical contact with the environment whilst dealing with the constantly changing and expansive surroundings. As well as these evasive elements there\u2019s also combat sections in the game where a dynamic targeting system is used which calls for fast reflex combinations.  The game supports the latest virtual reality technology as well as having multi-player mode which enables up to 32 people to play head to head. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven though it\u2019s a slick action game the story is very important part of your journey, as well as being your call to action it will reveal revelations along your action packed ride. Some of the story is told at high pace but there are some slower paced transition sections at the end of each level where we develop the narrative for the player. Without giving too much away you have someone guiding you through the game who talks to you telepathically. Their role is not only to orientate you but to help unfold the story for the player as you find out who you are and why you\u2019re on the ship.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Oculus Rift mode literally transports you inside the Infinity spaceship to be totally immersed in the thick of the action. The game-play is designed to complement the VR mode so you get the best experience possible and it enhances the game by adding another dimension to the playing experience. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is also another feature that transforms the game into a unique experience, the multi-player mode. This allows up to a 32 players to battle it out head to head to find out who\u2019s the ultimate Infinity Runner.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nInfinity Runner packs a lot into one super slick sci-fi action game bundle and with it re-invents the running genre!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFEATURES<br />\r\n* WEREWOLVES IN SPACE!<br />\r\n* 14 ACTION PACKED LEVELS<br />\r\n* ARCADE MODE<br />\r\n* STORY-MODE<br />\r\n* OCULUS RIFT MODE (DK1 - DK2 Runtime 4.4)<br />\r\n* WOLF LEVELLING SYSTEM<br />\r\n* MULTI-PLAYER MODE WITH UP TO 32 PLAYERS<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSTARSHIP INFINITY SPECIFICATION<br />\r\nOver 150 miles long and nearly 30 miles in diameter at its widest point, the progress of The Infinity's construction at the Tranquillity Ship yards on the Moon could clearly be seen from Earth. The revolutionary ship requires a crew of 5,000,000 people to keep it running and is designed to house another 10 million people as general population ready for the colonisation of new worlds. The Bio-domes, seen along the side of the ship, house forests that cover nearly 60,000 square miles in total, providing oxygen and a food source for the population and an environment for rest and relaxation. The greatest technological achievement can be found in the engine room, which houses the revolutionary Infinity Drive. It is vastly smaller than previous engines at a mere 10 miles long and far more powerful than traditional models which would take up to a third of the length of a starship, creating space for more brave colonists heading out into the unknown.",

Torment: Tides of Numenera is a single-player, isometric, narrative-driven role-playing game set in Monte Cook\u2019s Numenera universe, and brought to you by the creative team behind Planescape: Torment and the award-winning <strong>Wasteland 2<\/strong>. <br><br>Features: <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>A Deep, Thematically Satisfying Story.<\/strong> The philosophical underpinnings of Torment drive the game, both mechanically and narratively.

You will decide the fates of those around you, and characters will react to your decisions and reputation. The result is a deeply replayable experience that arises naturally from your actions throughout the game. <br><\/li><li><strong>A New Take on Combat.<\/strong> With the Crisis system, combat is more than just bashing your enemies. Plan your way through hand-crafted set-pieces which combine battles with environmental puzzles, social interaction, stealth, and more.<\/li><\/ul>",

You can dock at any friendly station and board any hostile ship, but it's not a space exploration game.<br><br><\/li><li>It's not multiplayer: The friends features mentioned above are fun but they're just sharing content, it's not multiplayer at all and you're never in the same world together.<\/li><\/ul><br>There are cool games about all those things.

    "detailedDescription": "You are a dead, failed video game character wandering through the recesses of the Random Access Memory, trying to find peace in the final moments of your existence before being deleted forever...<br><br>...but forget that. The real story is that Continue? is an existential metaphor that explores the finite nature of existence and the beauty and tyranny of our desires within it.<br><br><u><strong>From the developer:<\/strong><\/u><br><br>For fans of cerebral games such as Gone Home, The Novelist, and Papers Please.<br><br>This is one of those love it or hate it experimental art games. Regardless of whether you like it or not, I ensure you that it is like nothing you've ever played before. It's less about action and strategy and more about taking an emotional and philosophical journey that allows the player to explore his or her own sense of mortality. You will be very, very confused along the way, but your interpretation of this confusion is what the game is all about. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is not looking for something very weird and different. Continue? is for the type of person that appreciates odd, poetic word play, interpretation of the abstract, and existential philosophy.<br><br>Some games we play to kill time on a long commute, some we play at home to blow off steam after a hard day\u2019s work, and some games are about escaping into a world more magical than our own. Continue? is meant to be played late at night with some wine or weed, when you're feeling quiet and contemplative.<br><br>Everything in Continue? has a deeper meaning behind it. All of the strange places you go to, people you talk to, and scenarios you go through are part of a greater idea that I hope you spend a second or two trying to figure out and interpret...or not. You can also just play the damn thing.<br><br><u><strong>What happens to dead video game characters?<\/strong><\/u><br><br>In the garbage dump of the Random Access Memory, you travel from town to town, meeting people who offer you their lightning and their prayer. Lightning clears the way for you to move forward and prayer builds shelters in a distant town where you must frequently hide to avoid being deleted into nothingness by the garbage collector. Along the way, you are thrust into many battle challenges, the outcome of which affects your shelters. There is ultimately, no way to escape the garbage collector, but running from it buys you time to think, wander, contemplate, and hopefully be at peace with the inevitability of your deletion.<br><br>Each game randomly assigns you 1 of the 6 characters and 6 of the 11 areas. There is no set order to the stages of the game.<br><br><u><strong>Development<\/strong><\/u><br><br>Continue? was inspired by existential road trips into nowhere, Peruvian jungle drugs, and a brush with death while lost in the mountains of New Mexico. It is a quest for wonder, contemplation, and peace. <br><br><u><strong>By:<\/strong><\/u><br><br>Continue?9876543210 was independently developed by Jason Oda in 2013.

While <i>Martian Memorandum (1991)<\/i> continued this tradition of excellent, engaging, and visually stunning gameplay, it wasn't until <i>Under a Killing Moon (1994)<\/i> that the series really took a leap into the forefront of PC gaming.<br><br><i>Under a Killing Moon<\/i> not only provided players with rich full-motion video but was also one of the first games to feature a true Hollywood cast. As for the gameplay experience: it was unparalleled. Utilizing Access Software's amazing &quot;Virtual World&quot; engine, the game provided players with completely explorable full-3D environments. Crouch under desks, rifle through drawers, or stand on your toes to glance at the top shelf of a cabinet. Nothing was off-limits, and no other game utilized such immersive technology. Under a Killing Moon would go on to win many awards, including &quot;Best Fantasy Role-Playing/Adventure Program&quot; at the Codie Awards. <br><br><i>The Pandora Directive (1996)<\/i> continued this tradition of groundbreaking technology by being one of the first FMV adventure titles to feature multiple endings, multiple gameplay paths, and shipped on 6 compact discs. It also featured Hollywood acting talent and won &quot;Best adventure game of 1996&quot; by both Computer Gaming World, and Computer Game Entertainment.<br><br><i>Tex Murphy: Overseer (1998)<\/i> would come next, and would be the first PC game title to be released on the very new (at the time) DVD format. This enabled the game's full-motion video to be presented at levels of quality never before seen in a video game. While the game was a re-telling of the original <i>Mean Streets<\/i> story, it also featured Hollywood acting talent, and a completely redesigned 3D Virtual World engine.<br><br>16 years would pass between Overseer's release and Tesla Effect's continuation of the series (thanks to a successfully funded Kickstarter campaign). It would once again maintain Tex Murphy's tradition of ground-breaking adventure game entertainment with 2K full-motion video, full 3D environments, and a dynamic cast of actors to help bring the long-awaited continuation of the Tex Murphy saga to life.<br><br>To learn more about the Tex Murphy series, visit <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://bigfinishgames.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noopener\"  >http://bigfinishgames.com<\/a>.",

The sequel is included in the Dusty Skies Edition. Buy them together and save 10%!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>OVERVIEW<\/strong><\/h2><br><i>&quot;These days, folks have a lot of funny ideas about what makes a Real Cowboy...&quot;<\/i><br><br><strong>The Real Texas<\/strong> is an action adventure game that plays like a mashup of Zelda: Link to the Past and Ultima VI.<br><br>Sam, an ordinary Texas rancher, is on holiday in England when he steps through a blue portal and into a purgatory dimension, Strange:<br><br>Here, a friendly witch is handing out guns to visitors. A crazed, German-speaking wizard hurls elecbolts from his castle. And upriver, something's going on that involves a lot of chickens.<br><br>Stuck in the middle sits Sam, <strong>a Real Cowboy.<\/strong><br><br>... But that's just his job title back home-- it's not obvious that it's of any practical help here!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>USER REVIEWS<\/strong><\/h2><br>The game has been out for awhile-- here's some reviews from other sites:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <i>&quot;This thing is like some bizarre voxel dream, with its square, swaggerin' cowboys and its castles and insane German wizard-scientists and talking rats . . . It's fun and beautiful and a little bit rough on purpose, and I suppose I'll never forget it.&quot;<\/i> - Abram03<br><\/li><li> <i>&quot;i will never forget this surreal nostalgic ride. i haven't had such a rewarding experience in a long time.&quot;<\/i> - countersweet<br><\/li><li> <i>&quot;This game is incredible and I cannot recommend it enough to everyone.&quot;<\/i> - Microwave<\/li><\/ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FEATURES<\/strong><\/h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Kill things with six types of classic cowboy and fantasy weapons<br><\/li><li> Rummage through peoples' houses without fear of retribution while they go about their daily business<br><\/li><li> Help people out with their PROBLEMS (*rolls eyes*) often by shooting your gun many, many times-- just like real life!<br><\/li><li> Many special items and powerups, optional areas, and two types of chicken cutlets to collect<br><\/li><li> Wear a bullet-proof vest underneath a sequined evening-gown if you want<br><\/li><li> Supports all main game/life perlis including boss battles, enemies, traps, the estate tax<\/li><\/ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>IMPROVEMENTS AND OTHER NOTES<\/strong><\/h2>For the Steam release I added achievements, improved the framerate, added more compatibility options, remastered the sound effects and optimized things generally.<br><br><br>Even without the mini-sequel it's a lot improved over the original release. But I was careful to NOT ret-conn the original game. People seemed to really like it, so I wanted to respect that by not changing it up in any way.<br><br>To complete The Real Texas takes maybe about 10 hours, depending on what you want to do. Cellpop Goes Out At Night might take about 1-2 hours. Both the main game and the sequel have lots of secrets and weird things to uncover. In fact, there are some things that still haven't been figured out (to my knowledge) in four years... So I made it an achievement. Ha-ha! Good luck. :)<br><br>I've put a lot of love into both of these games, and I hope you will find them special and enjoyable. Thanks!",

Please see <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.theastronauts.com/2015/09/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-redux-out-now/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noopener\"  >this link<\/a> for details.<br><br>The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a first-person story-driven mystery game that focuses entirely on exploration and discovery. It contains no combat or explosions of any kind. If our game leaves any scars, we hope you won\u2019t be able to see them.<br><br>You play the game as Paul Prospero, an occult-minded detective who receives a disturbing letter from Ethan Carter. Realizing the boy is in grave danger, Paul arrives at Ethan\u2019s home of Red Creek Valley, where things turn out to be even worse than he imagined. Ethan has vanished in the wake of a brutal murder, which Paul quickly discerns might not be the only local murder worth looking into.<br><br>Inspired by the weird fiction (and other tales of the macabre) from the early twentieth century, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter aims to significantly evolve immersive storytelling in games. While it features a private detective and quite a few mental challenges, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is not an especially puzzle-ridden game. Our focus is on atmosphere, mood, and the essential humanity of our characters.<br><br>Still, the discoveries won\u2019t happen on their own, or without your help. Using both Paul\u2019s supernatural skill of being able to communicate with the dead, and your own powers of observation, you will discover the mystery behind a trail of corpses, the roots of a dark ancient force lurking in Red Creek Valley, and the fate of a missing boy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features<\/h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Explore and interact with the beautiful yet ominous world of Red Creek Valley<\/strong>, which was created with the use of revolutionary photogrammetry technology that allows for nearly photorealistic environments.<br><\/li><li><strong>Communicate with the dead and see how they died in order to gather clues<\/strong> that help you piece together the truth behind Ethan\u2019s disappearance -- and the fate of his family.<br><\/li><li><strong>Experience, in non-linear fashion, a story that combines the pleasures of pulp, private eye, and horror fiction<\/strong>, all of it inspired by writers such as Raymond Chandler, Algernon Blackwood, Stefan Grabinski, and H. P. Lovecraft.<br><\/li><li><strong>Conduct the investigation on your own terms and at your own pace<\/strong>. Although there are a few scary bits in the game, players will have no need for sedatives. Our game is less about terror and more about clammy unease.<\/li><\/ul>",

The wars, famines and suffering of the last 20 millennia were to become a distant, fading memory, as scientific advances brought global peace and prosperity. Toward the end of the 20th century, a now forgotten US president even went so far as to officially proclaim the arrival of a New World Order, in which right, not might, would govern international relations. This bright future was not to be. First came a meltdown of the international stock and currency exchanges. Then the major international conglomerates were dissolved in a vain attempt to stop the fiscal hemorrhage. By 2012 the world economy had collapsed. Poverty and hunger caused social and political tensions to flare. As the crisis wore on, few were bold or naive enough to predict anything positive for the future. Most realized that the planet was on the verge of global conflict.<br><br>In 2048, the anticipated global conflict broke out with a violence that shook the planet to its core. All major centralized governments were destroyed in the maelstrom. Europe and Eastern Asia bore the brunt of the devastation, as entire urban centres, from Madrid to Moscow and from Seoul to Singapore were literally wiped off the map. <br>The human race has always been known for its resiliency. Within a dozen years, the Earth's inhabitants had begun to restore their old nationalities - with a few twists. Twelve states of the former United States joined together to form a new country, called the United Civilized States. The UCS citizens had essentially given up their old roles as producers and leaders. Nearly all work was being performed by robots which are controlled by expert computer systems. Not surprisingly, the human inhabitants of the UCS had become lazy and decadent.<br><br>The 20th-century dream for a better world had ended in death and destruction.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>EARTH 2150: THE MOON PROJECT<\/strong><\/h2>The year 2150 \u2026 one of the blackest chapters in the history of mankind.

Famous scientists from the Lunar corporation, a long forgotten colony on the moon first recognized the signs of the imminent catastrophe. According to their calculations  the distance between the sun and earth would decrease in the next few years by 17%, which would lead to terrible consequences.<br><br>The only hope left for the population was the escape to the red planet Mars.

    "detailedDescription": "Kisaragi Academy student Mayu Suzumoto is transferring to a new high school, leaving behind a sizable group of friends and countless lovely memories. To help her cope with this move, her friend Ayumi has devised a seemingly innocent plan: the whole group will come together to perform a charm she found on the internet called \u201cSachiko Ever After,\u201d which is supposed to bind all of its participants together as friends to the end.<br><br>This does not go as expected.<br><br>Following an intense earthquake, the group awakens to find themselves separated and trapped in an alternate reality version of Heavenly Host Elementary, a tragedy-stricken institution that once stood on the site of their own school but was torn down long ago. Here, the vengeful spirits of elementary-aged children threaten their lives and their sanity, and the only hope of escape \u2013 much less survival \u2013 is to uncover the chilling details surrounding the murders of those trapped before them.<br><br><i>Corpse Party<\/i> is the original Windows edition of the cult classic horror game that gained a considerable fanbase when released on Sony\u2019s PlayStation®Portable system in 2011. Beginning life as an independent RPG Maker adventure title in 1996, the gameplay was greatly refined and the story greatly expanded for this 2008 remake, featuring more characters, more detailed interactions, darker story elements, over 5,000 lines of voice-acting and dozens of shocking, gruesome endings. Players take control of nine main characters and several side characters who\u2019ve been split up into groups of two or three and trapped in a run-down, otherworldly elementary school full of vengeful spirits, deadly mysteries and \u2013 of course \u2013 corpses. As they walk around examining objects and bodies in an atmospheric 2D environment, a horror tale spanning over 50 years begins to unfold, and player choices determine both how the story ends and who lives to see it through.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>KEY FEATURES<\/strong><\/h2><strong>Highly Detailed Retro-Style Graphics Used to Enhance Atmosphere<\/strong><br>Modeled after the very first RPG Maker <i>Corpse Party<\/i>, the game\u2019s 16-bit-style 2D visuals help create an intentional disconnect that sparks the imagination, leading the player to envision far worse things than even the most powerful next-gen system could display.<br><br><strong>Adventure-Style Gameplay Where Your Decisions Make All the Difference<\/strong><br>Playing like a cross between a point-and-click adventure game and a classic JRPG sans battles, <i>Corpse Party<\/i> gives players the freedom to thoroughly explore every last corner of Heavenly Host Elementary School, significantly altering the course of the story and its final conclusion based on where the characters go and what they do.<br><br><strong>Chapter-Based Storytelling with PC-Exclusive Content<\/strong><br>The tale is told through five main chapters with multiple endings each and numerous scenes that differ from the game\u2019s PSP™ system and Nintendo 3DS™ system counterparts. In addition, there are four bonus chapters, one of which is a PC-exclusive retelling of the \u201cTooth\u201d story from <i>Corpse Party: Book of Shadows<\/i>, recreated with added content in classic <i>Corpse Party<\/i> adventure style.<br><br><strong>Original Japanese Voice Cast and Character Art plus Text Skip Feature<\/strong><br>Over 5,000 lines of spoken Japanese dialogue from the original indie voice cast complement the action, giving new spins on familiar characters for series veterans. In addition, the original PC-exclusive character art is fully intact, and dedicated players seeking every ending are given a speedy fast-forward function to make replays a breeze.<br><br><strong>The Game That Started It All<\/strong><br>When first released in 2008, this title sparked a <i>Corpse Party<\/i> boom in Japan: remakes, sequels, spin-offs, fan games, manga, anime, a live-action drama series and more, as well as countless <i>Corpse Party<\/i>-inspired horror games created by other indie developers in the same style.

Other players are coming to take what's yours.  Build security to stop them.  Study their houses, buy tools, and break in to take what's theirs.  Everything you do is permanent.<br><br>I'm Jason Rohrer, and The Castle Doctrine is my 10th game.  It's a bit hard to describe, because there's never been anything quite like it before.  It's a brutal game in terms of its perma-death and perma-destruction consequences, and it is turn-based, so it's rather Rogue-like.  But building such a brutal game in a multiplayer context, with absolutely no cushion between players to stop them from brutalizing each other, is quite strange and new.  <br><br>Everything is real in this game.  When you rob someone, you are actually hurting another player in a permanent way by destroying and stealing their hard work.  When someone dies in this game, they lose everything and start over.  If you devise perplexing security systems, you can perma-death other players when they come to rob you.  Watching those security tapes, where someone gets what's coming to them, is an exhilarating experience.  On the other hand, you just killed someone and perhaps caused them to lose days of their hard work.  And you've been on the other side too, losing everything because of some thoughtless move you made in someone else's house.<br><br>But there is no randomness in this game, so everything is fair.  When you die, it is always your fault.  When things get dicey, you can always retreat back out the front door to save your own neck.  Of course, human folly will get the better of you.<br><br>Here's what you get when you buy the game:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A lifetime account on the central world server that I'm running.<br><\/li><li>Access to the full game source code (after launching the game on Steam, go <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://thecastledoctrine.net/sg/server.php?action=show_download_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noopener\"  >here<\/a>).<br><\/li><li>Everything you need to run your own game server (requires a PHP/MySQL web server, download the source bundle to get started).<\/li><\/ul>",

Players will discover the quirks of Wayward Manor\u2019s unwelcome guests and choose how to prey on their darkest fears.  <br> <br><strong>Story<\/strong><br>The Budds, a dysfunctional family of misfits and eccentrics, have brought their own abysmal possessions into your humble abode and stifled your power.
